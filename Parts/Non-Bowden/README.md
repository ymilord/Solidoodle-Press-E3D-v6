This is a WIP - As in I am (as you read this) still finalizing the parts for this. This verison will work- But use at your own risk.
 
 **NOTE** : I am still tweaking the mount/plug-in for the Z-Endstop for the Press to accomdate the height difference between the E3D v6 and the stock extruder. Also be mindful of the fact that you will lose some Z-height with this mod.

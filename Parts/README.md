# Parts for Press.
STL & STEP files.

Printed @  0.2mm Layer height - 20% Infill - 8 Perimeters (That's optional - I just used the same profile I use to print mounts of any kind. Just my personal preference)

This is a WIP (Work-In-Progess). I've uploaded the STL's for the Bowden Config for the SD Press. The STEP's will soon follow (I need to clean then up and label everything) As for the Non-Bowden verison. I am still designing the plug-in for the Z-Probe.

In the firmware folder, It has the INO & a precomplied HEX with changes to support the E3D v6 on the Press. Nothing else. 

Additional Parts Need :

Both : E3D v6 Universal /w Bowden Extras (Comes with a bowden tube) Then request either the 24V @ 25W or the 24V @ 40W Heater Cartridge. > http://www.filastruder.com/products/all-metal-e3d-v6-hotend

Non-Bowden Setup:

I use a short piece of PTFE tubing that have a "V" shape at the top (see the example image for details.)

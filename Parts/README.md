# Parts for Press.
STL & STEP files.

This is a WIP (Work-In-Progess). I've uploaded the STL's for the Bowden Config for the SD Press. The STEP's will soon follow (I need to clean then up and lable everything) As for the Non-Bowden verison. I am still designing the plug-in for the Z-Probe.

In the firmware folder, It has the INO & a precomplied HEX with changes to support the E3D v6 on the Press. Nothing else.

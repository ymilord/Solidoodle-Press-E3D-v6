This is a WIP - As in I am (as you read this) still finalizing the parts for this. This verison will work- But use at your own risk.

Added mount kit for the SD2. Same design and concept of the Press mount with an additional mount screw and a PTFE tube at the top for better flexible filament performance. This same updates will be applied to the Press Non-Bowden mount soon.
 
 **NOTE** : On the Press, I am still tweaking the mount/plug-in for the Z-Endstop for the Press to accomdate the height difference between the E3D v6 and the stock extruder. Also be mindful of the fact that you will lose some Z-height with this mod.
